# RURAL EDUCATION
**Problem:** No proper Education System in rural areas which supresses the development of the country.

**Idea:** Online Classes

**Solution:** What happens is there are many online classes available on the internet. 
But a very few of them are free. And even if they are free, they are not valid or affiliated with any of the institution. So even if an individual learns from it, it’s not accepted by any of the reputed company.
So first our motive will be to get an affiliation with the reputed institutions. It won’t be affiliated to a single institution, rather it will focus on the universities who are specialised in that particular field.
By this what we are trying to achieve is that the students who excel in a particular field get the opportunity to enhance their skills with professional training.
This program will be Subject wise and not class wise. So, an individual can easily concentrate on his specialised skills, rather than learning everything.
As the program mainly concentrates on rural areas, so by this method it will save their money, time & resources, which will encourage them to learn.
We’ll be conducting both online as well as offline test at particular interval of time. Online test will be taken every week with new topic as in consideration. Whereas offline test will be taken twice in a year.
By online test they can see their own progress accordingly. Whereas offline test will keep the integrity of certificate.
It will require a heavy investment in beginning stage of the project. It would be like a student loan. The company won’t be taking money on the first hand. The fees will be paid after the course itself. So the student themselves have to pay back the amount within a particular period of time. This will also help the pupils to be independent in terms of money. They won’t require their parent’s money. As rural people aren’t able to afford fees of big colleges.
